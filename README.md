# Simple NodeJS letter game

A simple letter game that I am going to put on the raspberry pi for my baby to bang on a keyboard and hear the letters that she hits.

## Installation

The main dependencies are [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and [festival](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/). The node module dependencies are defined in the `package.json` file so can be installed by using `npm install` at the root of the application.
